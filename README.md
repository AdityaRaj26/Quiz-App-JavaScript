# Quiz-App-JavaScript
Simple Interactive Quiz
This project is a simple interactive quiz application for beginners. It uses HTML to create the structure, CSS to style the quiz, and JavaScript to handle the quiz logic. The quiz presents multiple-choice questions, tracks the user's answers, and displays the score at the end. The HTML file sets up the layout with a question area and radio buttons for answer choices. The CSS file styles the quiz for a clean look. The JavaScript file dynamically loads questions, checks answers, and calculates the score.
